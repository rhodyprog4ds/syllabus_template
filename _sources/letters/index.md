# Letters to Future students

This section is a place for students enrolled in Fall 2020 to write letters to future students taking this class with Professor Brown. 
The websites for future sections will link back here for them to read. 


## Contributed Notes

<!-- use the following example line as a template to link to your letter -->

<!-- ### title or key takeaway -->
<!-- your advice can be as short as a single sentence or it can be a few paragraphs, whatever you like -->
<!-- it won't be anonymous because of the commit history, but you can choose to sign it or not and include 
information about what courses you had before this or not-->

### Reviewing notes
Especially when it comes to the difficult topics make sure you go back through the notes and try and add to them yourself. Actively using the new topics will help you learn a lot better than just copying the notes.

### Attend Office Hours
Attending office hours will help you better understand course material, complete homework assignments, and learn new things that might not normally come up in class.

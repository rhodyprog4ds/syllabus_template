## Syllabus FAQ



```{dropdown} How much does assignment x, class participation, or a portfolio check weigh in my grade?
There is no specific weight for any activities, because your grade is based on earning achievements for the skills listed in the [skills rubric](skill-rubric).

However, if you do not submit (or earn no achievements from) assignments or portfolios, the maximum grade you can earn is a C.
If you do not submit (or earn no achievements from) your portfolio, the maximum grade you can earn is a B.

```{dropdown} Can I submit this assignment late if ...?
No, late assignments are not accepted. Your grade is based on the skills, not the assignments. All skills are assessed in at least two [assignments](assignment-skills), so missing any one will not hurt your grade. If you need an accommodation because you cannot submit multiple assignments, contact Dr. Brown.
